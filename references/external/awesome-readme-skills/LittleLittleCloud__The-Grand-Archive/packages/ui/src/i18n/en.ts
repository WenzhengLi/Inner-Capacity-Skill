  // FAQ
  faq: {
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    q1: "What is dak-news (The Grand Archive)?",
    a1: "dak-news is a real-time news aggregation database purpose-built for AI agents and LLM workflows. It continuously ingests articles from 20+ authoritative sources — Bloomberg, CNBC, BBC, AP News, Hacker News, and more — and exposes them through a structured API so that AI agents can search, filter, and cite real news without hallucinating.",
    q2: "How is dak-news different from Google News or other news aggregators?",
    a2: "Traditional aggregators are designed for humans browsing headlines. dak-news is designed for machines. Every entry is structured with metadata (source, category, date, relevance score), searchable via full-text API, and accessible through a TypeScript SDK, CLI, or plain REST — so your AI agent can query the news programmatically instead of scraping web pages.",
    q3: "Which news sources does dak-news track?",
    a3: "We track 20+ sources across four categories: Finance & Macro (Bloomberg, CNBC, MarketWatch, 华尔街见闻, 第一财经, 财新网, ZeroHedge, 金十数据, 雪球), International & Geopolitics (BBC Chinese, NYT Chinese, Al Jazeera, AP News, Foreign Affairs, The Diplomat, 参考消息, 人民网), Tech (Hacker News), and Social Trending (Weibo Hot, Zhihu Hot). New sources are added regularly.",
    q4: "How do I connect dak-news to my AI agent (Claude, Clawdbot, etc.)?",
    a4: "The fastest way is to share dak-news.com/AGENTS.md with your agent — it contains everything the agent needs to start querying news immediately. For deeper integration, you can install the dak AI Skill ('npx skills add LittleLittleCloud/The-Grand-Archive'), use the TypeScript SDK (@littlelittlecloud/dak), the CLI tool (@littlelittlecloud/dak-cli), or call the REST API directly at dak-news.com/api.",
    q5: "Is dak-news free to use?",
    a5: "Yes — anonymous access gives you 28 days of search history with no sign-up required. A free account extends that to 90 days with higher rate limits and API key access. Premium plans offer unlimited history and dedicated support for production workloads.",
